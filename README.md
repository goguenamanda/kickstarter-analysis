At a closer glance, we can see that although theatre was the most successful category in the United states, it also had an almost equivalent rate of failure.

In Great Britain, theatre campaigns had a higher success-to-failure ratio than in the United States.

Based on all of the above information, I would recommend that Louise run a kickstarter campaign in the month of May. I'd suggest that she run her campaign in Great Britain in the 'play' subcategory in order to increase the likelihood of running a successful campaign.
